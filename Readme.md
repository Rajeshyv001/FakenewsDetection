## Fake News Detection

The motivation behind developing this website so that people should be aware about fake news or rumours before taking any further action.We can take an example of recent event when WHO declared COVID -19 a global pandemic which causes panic, anxiety, fear and financial crisis and also led to the rise in false news. An International Studies showed that India (about 15.94 %), US (about 9.74 %), Brazil (about 8.57 %) and Spain (about 8.03 %) are the four most false news affected countries. Fake news isnâ€™t new problem but due to advancement in technology and increased in social media users, this false news increased sharply in recent years. As these false news now easily be created using bots and diffused via online social networks globally just by a few clicks. Fake news are tend to be created by creators to get viral by attracting their attention and triggering emotional sentiments.
#### So, we created a machine learning model which will predict whether the news is fake or real so to avoid confusion and able to handle panic, chaos and violence beforehand.
